- Discover seasonal and regional patterns that influence sales

Support data-driven recommendations for marketing, inventory, and operations

##  Key Insights
### Sales & Time Trends
Sales peaked in 2018, followed by a dip in 2020.

Quarter 3 (Julâ€“Sep) consistently saw the highest sales, with November and August emerging as strong months.

No major correlation was observed between price changes and quantity sold, indicating price insensitivity or fixed pricing.

### Sales Team Performance
Team Delta led by Brittany Bold was the best-performing team across most years.

Jimmy Grey was the top-performing sales rep.

All teams performed similarly in terms of channel and sub-channel distribution, with Pharmacy Retail being the most profitable.

### Product-Level Insights
Analgesics, Mood Stabilizers, and Antiseptics were top-performing product classes by quantity and revenue.

Sales and quantity sold were strongly correlatedâ€”no "premium" low-volume products were observed.

Antipyretics and Antimalarials were consistently low-selling.

### Regional & Channel Performance
Butzbach was the top-performing city, while BiaÃ…â€šogard consistently underperformed across years.

Channels showed similar sales behavior across regions, with Pharmacy > Retail leading.

No significant impact of sub-channel on performance was observed.

On average, customers purchased 73% of the available product catalog, with Welch-Orn Pharmacy leading in product diversity.
